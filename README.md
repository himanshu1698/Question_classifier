# Sentence Question Identification using Natural Language Processing

## Overview

This project aims to tackle the seemingly simple yet surprisingly challenging task of identifying whether a given sentence is a question or not using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. While distinguishing between questions and statements appears to be straightforward for humans, it's a problem that lacks a universally effective solution when it comes to automated processing.

The project uses the CoQA (Conversational Question Answering) dataset, which is a rich and extensive resource designed for building Conversational Question Answering systems. CoQA stands for "coca," and it comprises a large collection of questions and answers gathered from real conversations. This dataset provides an excellent foundation for training a machine learning model to identify questions in a conversational context.

### CoQA Dataset

The CoQA dataset contains the following key characteristics:

- **Scale:** It boasts an extensive collection of 127,000+ questions with answers, all of which were collected from more than 8000 conversations. This scale allows for robust model training and evaluation.

- **Conversational Context:** The questions in CoQA are conversational, meaning they are often interconnected and related to the context of a passage. This mirrors the complexity of understanding questions in real conversations.

- **Free-Form Answers:** The answers in CoQA are not limited to predefined options. Instead, they can be in the form of free-text responses, making the task more challenging.

- **Evidence Subsequences:** Each answer in the dataset comes with an evidence subsequence highlighted in the passage. This helps in understanding where the answer is derived from.

- **Diverse Domains:** CoQA passages are collected from seven diverse domains, introducing complexity and variety into the dataset.

- **Challenging Phenomena:** The dataset includes phenomena like coreference and pragmatic reasoning, which are not commonly found in existing reading comprehension datasets. This makes it an excellent resource for tackling complex NLP challenges.

## Methodology

The project's approach involves using the CoQA dataset to create training data. Once the training data is prepared, a BERT-based model will be trained to identify whether a given sentence is a question or not. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful NLP model known for its context-awareness and excellent performance on various NLP tasks.

The following steps outline the methodology for this project:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The CoQA dataset will be preprocessed to extract relevant passages, questions, and answers. This data will be used to create a labeled dataset for training the model.

2. **Training Data Creation:** The labeled dataset will be prepared, where each sentence is labeled as either a question or not a question.

3. **Model Selection:** A BERT-based model will be chosen and fine-tuned using the training data.

4. **Model Training:** The selected model will be trained using the labeled dataset to learn the patterns that distinguish questions from non-questions.

5. **Evaluation:** The model's performance will be assessed using appropriate metrics to measure its accuracy in identifying questions.

6. **Deployment:** Once the model is trained and performs satisfactorily, it can be deployed for various applications, such as chatbots, content filtering, or question-answering systems.

## Conclusion

The goal of this project is to tackle the deceptively simple problem of sentence question identification using the CoQA dataset and advanced NLP techniques. Despite its apparent simplicity, this task poses several challenges, especially in a conversational context with free-form answers and complex linguistic phenomena. By using the CoQA dataset and a BERT-based model, we aim to build an effective solution for this problem.
